# OHBA-Examples

This repository contains example scripts for analysing various public neuroimaging datasets.

Also see [osl-ephys](https://github.com/OHBA-analysis/osl-ephys/tree/main/examples) for generic examples for different MEG scanners.

Note, some of the examples maybe out of date and require small modifications to make them run.

## Installation
